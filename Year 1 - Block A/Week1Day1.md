## 2.1 What is artificial intelligence?
### 2.1b How would you define ‘artificial intelligence'?
Artificial intelligence is an algorithm based on machine learning and neural networks that enables the program to analyse processes and learn from them.

### 2.1c Give three examples of AI applications. You can choose real-life examples, but also examples from popular culture (e.g., movies, books, video games etc.).
- Siri as an example for AI in Chatbots/Smart Assistants
- Google Search as an example of smart search recommendations
- Face recognition software in CCTV

##2.2 Philosophy of artificial intelligence
### 2.2b Define the following terms: ‘weak AI', and ‘strong AI'.
| Weak AI | Strong AI |
|---|---|
| (narrow AI) | (artificial general intelligence - AGI) |
| Weak AI is based on human made algorithms  that determine what specific should be performed.  This concept purely relies on data to insure accuracy  and provide a base for the relevant training. | Strong AI is a form of AI that focuses on algorithms  that mimic human learning processes. It is using meant  to be self-conscious with the ability to reason like a  human being. Although the concept for it exists already,  it is still not a reality. |

### 2.2d What is the ‘Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.
In the Chinese room experiment we have two people, Person 1 sitting inside the room and Person 2 sitting outside of the room. Person 1 cannot understand Chinese unlike Person 2. Person 1 is now given instruction papers on what character to respond when handed a Chinese text from Person 2. Person 1 can now find the characters from the text on the instruction paper and respond with the correlating characters. Person 1 can therefore communicate with Person 2 even though he doesn't speak Chinese.

### 2.2e What is the ‘Chinese room experiment' supposed to show? Select the correct statement, and elaborate on your choice:
a) Computers are not yet able to simulate the human ability to understand
b) Understanding involves more than the ability to formally reproduce appropriate outputs
c) It is only possible for systems to demonstrate understanding
==d) No machine can demonstrate genuine understanding==

The Chinese room experiment shows, that machines can perform tasks without understanding the output just like Person 1 did in the experiment.
