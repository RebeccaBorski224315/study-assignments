One milestone in AI history was the invention of the **General Problem Solver (GPS)** by *Herbert Simon*, *J.C. Shaw* and *Allen Newell* in **1959**. GPS was the first program that was intended to solve specific tasks unlike earlier programs that were only designed to perform one specific task.

One of the key ideas of the GPS program was the so called **physical symbol system hypothesis (PSSH)**. This hypothesis proposed, that symbols are the key to general intelligence. They believed that a crucial component of human understanding consisted of simply connecting symbols, and that our language, ideas, and concepts were really large collections of these connected symbols. They argued that when we see or read about an object, we can associate it with its use and if we could program a machine to connect symbols the way humans do, and create enough of these connections, machines would behave more like us.

However, not everyone agreed with this notion. John Searle, a philosopher, asserted in 1980 that intelligence could not be defined as the mere act of connecting symbols. He developed an experiment known as the **Chinese room argument** to make his case against the assertion that computers think or at least have the ability to think in the future.
