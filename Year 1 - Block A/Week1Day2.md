# History of Artificial Intelligence

## Timeline

### 1.1c Find, and describe one ‘milestone' in the history of AI. Be creative, so no ‘milestones' by Alan Turing! No worries, we are going to extensively discuss his accomplishments in DataLab 1, Week 2 :smiley:
One milestone in AI history was the invention of the **General Problem Solver (GPS)** by *Herbert Simon*, *J.C. Shaw* and *Allen Newell* in **1959**. GPS was the first program that was intended to solve specific tasks unlike earlier programs that were only designed to perform one specific task.

One of the key ideas of the GPS program was the so called **physical symbol system hypothesis (PSSH)**. This hypothesis proposed, that symbols are the key to general intelligence. They believed that a crucial component of human understanding consisted of simply connecting symbols, and that our language, ideas, and concepts were really large collections of these connected symbols. They argued that when we see or read about an object, we can associate it with its use and if we could program a machine to connect symbols the way humans do, and create enough of these connections, machines would behave more like us.

However, not everyone agreed with this notion. John Searle, a philosopher, asserted in 1980 that intelligence could not be defined as the mere act of connecting symbols. He developed an experiment known as the **Chinese room argument** to make his case against the assertion that computers think or at least have the ability to think in the future.

## Alan Turing
### 1.2b Besides the Turing Test, Alan Turing is renowned for his work on:
1. **the universal Turing machine**, an abstract computer that contains the fundamental logical ideas behind a digital computer.
2. **Church-Turing thesis**, everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine
3. **Bombe**, a military code-breaking machine similar to the Bomba

### 1.2e Describe the procedure, and main objective of Turing's ‘Imitation Game'. Write your answer down
Alan Turing invented the imitation game to determine whether or not a computer is able to think like a human. According to Turing, a machine is said to have artificial intelligence if it can simulate human behaviour in certain situations. 

Three terminals are needed for the original imitation game, each of which is physically isolated from the other two. While the other two are run by humans, one terminal is run by a computer.

One of the humans serves as the test's questioner, and the other human, along with the computer, serve as the test's replies. The questioner asks the respondents questions about a particular topic while adhering to a predetermined format and context. The questioner is then asked to determine which respondent was a human and which was a computer after a specified amount of time or questions.

The test is run repeatedly. The computer is deemed to have artificial intelligence if the questioner cannot separate more than 50% of the computers answers from the answers of the human.
